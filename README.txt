There are four files in this repository

1. 'run.sh' file is the unix shell script with a shebang added for bash terminal. This file can be executed on any linux/macOS Server.

2. The main.py file is the python script that fetches, calculates, and write/output the data-metrics

3. Dependencies.txt is a text file containing the list of python packages that needs to be installed for running the script successfully. (These will automatically be installed by the run.sh file)

4. output.xlsx is the file where the python script will write the data after running. This file can be changed if required by updating the output_data variable in the main.py file with the new file name
